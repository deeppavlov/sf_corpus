# Speech Function Corpus

This repository contains the code for our SIGDIAL paper 'ChatGPT vs. Crowdsourcing vs. Experts: Annotating Open-Domain Conversations with Speech Functions'. The jupyter notebook with the code otself can be found [here](https://github.com/deeppavlov/sf_corpus/blob/main/SF_annotation_ChatGPT.ipynb). Note that you need your own OpenAI API token to run the code. All the gold standard files and drawio schemes of the annotation pipeline are [here](https://github.com/deeppavlov/sf_corpus/tree/main/files). For an exhaustive overview of the entire annotation tree, see [this drawio scheme](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ff9OrRG3ZWyJIJlQIywNmK37yxbfUqfG/view?usp=sharing).
