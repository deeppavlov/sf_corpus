# Speech Function Corpus

All the code for our SIGDIAL paper 'ChatGPT vs. Crowdsourcing vs. Experts: Annotating Open-Domain
Conversations with Speech Functions' is [here](https://github.com/deeppavlov/sf_corpus/blob/main/sf_corpus_chatgpt_annotation/SF_annotation_ChatGPT.ipynb). Note that you need your own OpenAI API token to run the code. All the gold standard files and drawio schemes of the annotation pipeline are [here](https://github.com/deeppavlov/sf_corpus/tree/main/sf_corpus_chatgpt_annotation/files). For an exhaustive overview of the entire annotation tree, see [this drawio scheme](https://github.com/deeppavlov/sf_corpus/tree/main/sf_corpus_chatgpt_annotation/files/questions.drawio).

This repository contains all the scripts for pre- and post-processing the (annotated) dialogs & work with ChatGPT. Annotation pipeline for Toloka crowdsourcing platform can be found [here](https://github.com/deeppavlov/toloka_tools). Everything for Toloka front-end (and the structure of instructions) can be found [here](https://github.com/deeppavlov/discourse_toloka/tree/feat/full).
